        <p>This project takes in images from Maplestory's 5th job node page and input from the user to determine requirements to give
            multiple mix and match trios. It uses the same algorithm as the text solver but it uses computer vision techniques to
            analyze screen shots and extract the necessary information from just the screen shots. No Machine learning was used.

            This project is a general reference guide for Maplestory's 5th job system that is seperated by each class in the game.
            It is updated regularly by me whenever it is brought to my attention someone is outdated or inaccurate. I update sections
            after thorough research as to ensure the quality of the guide. This is a guide meant for players that have a general 
            understanding of the 5th job system and is by no means a beginner guide.

            This project is a general text based solver. The user puts a list of requirements in the left text box in the form
            "a,b,c,...". Then inputs a list of trios on the box to the right in the form:<br>
            "a,b,c<br>b,c,d<br>...".<br> Then after pressing calculate, the program will try and find a subset of the inputs given in the 
            middle box such that each element of the trios will span the requirements list twice, but it will not include trios which 
            begin with the same element.
